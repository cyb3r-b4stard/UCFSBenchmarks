    /* now impress the customer with your String functions by doing each of the following
        1.  Add a line that prints out the customer's name (first name then last name) along with how many letters are in the string.  
        2.  Next, convert the form of a name.  Convert your name from the firstname lastname form to the lastname, firstname form.  
        You will do this by separating this string into a first name and last name by using the methods indexOf and substring.  
        You may find it helpful to create three new, empty string variables for this process (one for lastName, one for firstName, 
        and one for nameInNewForm).
             a.  Search for the index of the space and save this number in a variable.
             b.  Create a substring for the first name from beginning of the named constant to the space.                    
             c.  Create a substring for the last name starting after the space and going to the end of the named constant.
        3.  Add statements to print the customer's name in the new form.  
        4.  Show the user that you can create the word ate from the name of our restaurant using substrings. */
