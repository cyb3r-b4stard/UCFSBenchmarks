    /**The object of the bidding game is this: Given the price of an item, you want to get as close as you can to the
    actual price without going over - like on the Price is Right. If you go over, you automatically lose,
    no matter how close you are to the actual price.
    You'll need to make 4 random numbers - the actual price, and the bids for the 3 computer contestants. You also need
    to grab the bid of the user from the keyboard.
    
    The output should be as follows:
    
    You bid: <user bid>
    Contestant 2 bid:
    Contestant 3 bid:
    Contestant 4 bid:
    The actual retail price was: <insert retail price>
    The winner is:
    
    You should also have the program repeat as long as the user enters a bid that is not 0. Use a do-while loop
    to accomplish this.
