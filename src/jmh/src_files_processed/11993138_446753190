	/* now impress the customer with your String functions by doing each of the following
		1.  Add a line that prints out the customer's name (first name then last name) along with how many letters are in the string.  
		2.  Next, convert the form of a name.  Convert your name from the firstname lastname form to the lastname, firstname form.  
		You will do this by separating this string into a first name and last name by using the methods indexOf and substring.  
		You may find it helpful to create three new, empty string variables for this process (one for lastName, one for firstName, 
		and one for nameInNewForm).
			 a.  Search for the index of the space and save this number in a variable.
			 b.  Create a substring for the first name from beginning of the named constant to the space.	                 
			 c.  Create a substring for the last name starting after the space and going to the end of the named constant.
		3.  Add statements to print the customer's name in the new form.  
		4.  Show the user that you can create the word ate from the name of our restaurant using substrings. */
	
	/*  Finally, impress the customer with some math "gymnastics".  
		1.  Write the code to calculate the number of sandwiches that would be left over if he/she divided the number of sandwiches
	        purchased among the members of a family of 6. Report this information to the customer.  
		2.  Tell the customer the number of items he/she would have if he/she cubed the number of items purchased.  
		3.  Ask the customer for his/her best estimate of the diameter of the sandwich.  Assume our sandwiches are 2 inches tall.
		Report to the customer the volume of the a sandwich (assume the sandwich is a in the shape of a cylinder) with the diameter that he/she suggested.  
		Use Java's best estimate of PI in the calculation  
		4.  Calculate the real solutions to a quadratic function which has a equal to the number of hamburgers, b equal to the number	
		of cheeseburgers and c equal to -1 MULTIPLIED BY the number of chicken sandwiches sold to the customer.  */
