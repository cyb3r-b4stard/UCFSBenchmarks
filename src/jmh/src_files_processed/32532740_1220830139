     * A number of the methods from the "static" version

     * That's because Raymond did not wish to test you on 
     * those methods a second time, having already tested 
     * your knowledge of those methods in the "static"
     * version.
     * 
     * Most of those methods would appear in a complete
     * version of this object-oriented version of the 
     * class, with the *ONLY* change being that the reserved 
     * word "static" would be deleted from the method 
     * header. 
     * 
     * The method setAccountNumber() would definitely NOT 
     * be copied across from the static version to this 
     * object-oriented version. That's because each object 
     * (i.e. instance of BankAccount) represents a unique 
     * bank account. The account number set up by the 
     * constructor should never change again.
     * 
     * The method setAccountName() MIGHT be copied across.  
     * That's a business decision.  Some banks might allow 
     * a customer to change their name.  Other banks might 
     * only allow a name change by creating a new account.  
     * If the account name cannot be changed, then the 
     * declaration of private data member "accountName" 
     * should have the reserved word "final" added.
     * 
     * The method withdraw() has been copied across 
     * because:
     * (1) it was provided in its entirety in the
     *     "static" version of the class,
     * (2) to provide an example that "static" is dropped 
     *     from the header,
     * (3) to provide a hint as to what changes might be 
     *     needed for the other, incomplete methods.
