/**
 In the Aquarium.java class: 
        
   1.  Add code to complete the who() method so that the name of the favorite fish in the tank is displayed when 
        the method is called.
        
 In the Aquariumtracker.java class: 
        
   2.   Construct a class object called myAquarium. Your 40-gallon tank will have 11 fish in it, with a total
        length for all the fish of 14.7 in. Your favorite fish, Trixie, will be in the tank.
        
   3.   Use a method of the Aquarium class to add 5 fish to your tank. The new fish will have 
        a total of 9.8 inches of length.

   3.   Add a statement that prints out what the value of the maximum length of all fish together should be.
   
   4.   Declare a variable "safe" that calculates the difference between the maximum length that all fish should 
        have, and the total length of all fish in the aquarium now.
   
   5.   Add a statement that checks to make sure the maximum length of the fish has not been exceeded, and
        if it is safe, print a message stating that it is safe to add more fish, including the number of
        inches of fish that can be added. If it is not safe, print a message stating that no more fish should
        be added.

   6.   Test your code so far and compare the result to this:
   
   YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO:
   Adding 5 more fish with a total length of 9.8
   Total length of fish in the tank is now: 24.5
   Max length of all fish should be 32.0
   You can safely add 7.5 inches of fish.
   My favorite fish is Trixie
   
   7.   Finally, change the code you wrote for step 3 so that 15 fish are added with a total length of 29.8 in.

   YOUR FINAL OUTPUT SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO:
   Adding 15 more fish with a total length of 29.8
   Total length of fish in the tank is now: 44.5
   Max length of all fish should be 32.0
   better not add any more fish!
   My favorite fish is Trixie
   
   BONUS (optional, +1 extra point)
   Add a line of code somewhere that reports the total number of fish in the tank after new fish have been added.
   Remember to display this number in your step 3 reporting method!
