     * You are tasked to complete the implementation of the printNumberLine(int seqCenter, int length) method which prints a sequence of digits with preceding and trailing white spaces on a single line of the terminal window.
     * The sequence of digits goes from 0 to the value of the method parameter seqCenter and then goes back to 0. Each subsequent digit in the sequence should be differ by 1. For example, if seqCenter has a value 3, the sequence of digits should be "0123210".
     * Equal amount of white spaces should be present before and after the digit sequence so that the length of the entire line is equal to the method parameter length.
     * 
     * @param number The number to take power.
     * @param power The power factor to be taken to.
     * @return The calculation result after taking power of the integer number.
